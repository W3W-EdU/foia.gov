<h1>Identify an agency to request from</h1>
<p>It’s important that you identify the correct agency for your request. There are over 100 agencies and each is responsible for handling its own FOIA requests. You can find a breakdown of agencies by topic on USA.gov to help you identify the correct agency. You may also search for agencies using the search bar below.</p>
<p>When choosing an agency, remember that some agencies can’t yet receive FOIA requests through FOIA.gov. For those agencies, this site will provide you with the information you need to submit a request directly to the agency.</p>
